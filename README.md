I'm a master's student in Mathematics at SMU; I have a BA in Mathematics with minors in Philosophy and Computer Science.
My core interests pertain to the science and social policy of advancing technology, and my next step is a JD/MBA.  I am proficient in the mathematics and programming of both quantum and traditional computing and the technologies and ethics of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity.
