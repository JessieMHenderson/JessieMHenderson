Hi!  I'm Jessie, a master's student in Mathematics at SMU. I have a BA in Mathematics with minors in Philosophy and Computer Science.
My core interests pertain to both the sciences and the social policies of advancing technologies. After my master's, I plan to attain a JD/MBA. I am proficient in the mathematics and programming of both quantum and traditional computing, have an operable understanding of the technologies and ethics of artificial intelligence, and am interested in delving further into cybersecurity and related disciplines.
