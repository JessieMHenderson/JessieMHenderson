Hi!  I'm Jessie, a senior President's Scholar at SMU. (Major: Mathematics; Minors: Philosophy and Computer Science)
My core interests pertain to both the sciences and the social policies of advancing technologies. I plan to attain a JD/MBA, and might thereafter pursue graduate work in mathematics or the sciences. I am proficient in the mathematics and programming of both quantum and traditional computing, have an operable understanding of the technologies and ethics of artificial intelligence, and am interested in delving further into cybersecurity and related disciplines.
