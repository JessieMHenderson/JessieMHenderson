My core interests pertain to the science, law, and social policy of advancing technology. I hold a masterâ€™s in computational and applied mathematics, and am an incoming 1L at The University of Chicago Law School. I am proficient in the mathematics and programming of both quantum and traditional computing, and in many of the technologies and ethics of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity.
